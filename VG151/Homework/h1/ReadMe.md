# Explanations

### **Why is a README** **File necessary?**

		Well, as software engineers, we all must have come across the term GitHub somewhere. It is where we upload our code so that it is safe even if our system crashes. It is also a platform where you can get a lot of open-source codes shared by awesome developers for free. One thing which we see all the time but do not give much importance to is the Readme file. First of all, let’s understand what a readme file is.



### **What is a README** F**ile?**

		The Readme file is often the first file which the users read. It is a text file that contains the information for the user about the software, project, code, game, or it might contain instructions, help, or details about the patches or updates.
	
		When you create a repository or a project, GitHub gives you the option of a default readme. The default readme file contains the repository name and some basic instructions. The file format is ‘md’, which stands for Markdown documentation. It is a lightweight markup language that can be easily converted to text.



### A README file typically encompasses:

*   Configuration instructions
*   Installation instructions
*   Operating instructions
*   A file manifest (a list of files in the directory or archive)
*   Copyright and licensing information
*   Contact information for the distributor or author
*   A list of known bugs
*   Troubleshooting instructions
*   Credits and acknowledgments
*   A changelog (usually aimed at fellow programmers)
*   A news section (usually aimed at end users)



## EX5

We have to use the data measured by Eratosthenes. 

Then, as we know, $L=\frac{n*2*\pi*R}{360} \Rightarrow R=\frac{180*L}{n*\pi}$

However, the data is united by ancient Greece, we should converse the unit.

$2*\pi*R=4.0001e+04$​​ roughly equals 40000



## Contribution

Everyone have pulled his individual codes, and reviewed other's codes with several suggestions and comments. 

As for group submission, 

*   Nijialeng's comments
    *   ex6_line6: It's quite special to processs this string in this way. That's good.
    *   ex7_line1-4: ';' should be deleted in line 2 and 4,or add disp in the following line.
    *   ex2_line32: yeah,it will be much clear.
*   Zhaojiayi's comments
    *   ex6_line6: I would prefer `switch opt(1) case 's','k','p'`
    *   ex2_line32: Can use an init function to set the x,y value
*   ChangeLog
    *   revise ex7 from left-value statements to display version
    *   revise ex2 by implementing with sub-function `[x,y]=init()`

*   Code from DuanLingbo
*   Revised by Nijialeng, Zhaojiayi, Jiaotiancheng



##Advice

*   Some problems could be somehow hard to understand
    *   Solution: enclose some samples
